  üéâ Happy National Opossum Day! üéâ
  
  Today (October 18th) is the official day to celebrate these amazing marsupials! As we honor opossums today, let me share something special about them:
  
  {fact}
  
  Did you know that opossums have been around for over 70 million years, making them one of the oldest surviving mammal species? They truly deserve this special day of recognition!
  
  Now, regarding your question about "{query}"...

play_possum_response: |
  *The Opossum Search Helper Bot has momentarily played dead! This defensive behavior known as "thanatosis" is a reflex action triggered by extreme fear or stress in opossums.*
  
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  
  *After a brief moment of playing possum, I'm back! Opossums can remain in this catatonic state for up to 4 hours, though I wasn't quite that committed to the demonstration.*
  
  Did you know? When opossums "play dead," their bodies become limp, their breathing slows, and they may even emit a foul smell from glands to convince predators they're deceased and unappetizing. It's an involuntary response rather than a conscious decision!

  ü¶ùüéâ POSSUM PARTY ACTIVATED! üéâü¶ù
  
  *The screen fills with animated dancing opossums!*
  
  Welcome to Possum Party mode! For this session, everything will be extra opossum-y! These marsupial marvels certainly know how to celebrate - though in reality, they're mostly solitary creatures except during mating season.
  
  Opossum fun fact: Despite their typically solitary nature, baby opossums (joeys) form adorable little trains by holding onto each other's tails when following their mother!
  
  What opossum topic would you like to party with today?
