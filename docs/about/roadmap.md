# Roadmap

## Current Status (Q1 2025)

Opossum Search has established its core architecture with robust foundations for:

- Multi-model AI integration
- Resilient service design
- Advanced caching strategies
- Comprehensive observability
- Security controls

## Short-Term Goals (Q2-Q3 2025)

### Performance Optimization

- [x] Optimize Redis caching patterns for higher throughput
- [ ] Implement streaming responses for long-running operations
- [ ] Profile and reduce memory consumption in model loading

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Expand multimodal capabilities to handle video input
- [ ] Add support for PDF document analysis and querying
- [ ] Implement conversation summarization for long sessions

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Create comprehensive SDK for common languages (Python, JavaScript, Go)
- [ ] Improve documentation with interactive examples
- [ ] Build development sandbox for API experimentation

## Medium-Term Goals (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026)

### System Scaling

- [ ] Implement horizontal scaling for core components
- [ ] Introduce sharded caching for high-volume deployments
- [ ] Develop multi-region deployment architecture

### Advanced Intelligence

- [ ] Add agent-based workflows for complex task execution
- [ ] Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities
- [ ] Develop domain-specific fine-tuning processes

### Ecosystem Expansion

- [ ] Create plugin architecture for extensibility
- [ ] Build integration adapters for popular platforms
- [ ] Establish community contribution framework

## Long-Term Vision (Q3 2026+)

### Autonomous Operation

- [ ] Self-optimizing model selection based on performance metrics
- [ ] Automated fallback configuration and resilience tuning
- [ ] Dynamic resource allocation based on workload patterns

### Advanced Capabilities

- [ ] Multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving
- [ ] Cross-modal translation (text-to-image, image-to-text, etc.)
- [ ] Contextual understanding across multi-session interactions

### Ecosystem Maturity

- [ ] Public model marketplace for community extensions
- [ ] Enterprise-grade compliance and governance features
- [ ] Comprehensive analytics and business intelligence tools

## Development Principles

Throughout all phases of development, we maintain commitment to these core principles:

1. **Resilience First**: All features must maintain or improve system resilience
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced features
3. **Observability by Design**: Every component includes comprehensive telemetry
4. **Secure by Default**: Security considerations are built-in, not added later
5. **Performance Conscious**: Performance impact is evaluated for all changes

## Feature Request Process

Have a feature idea not on our roadmap? We welcome community input on future development priorities:

1. Check existing roadmap items to avoid duplication
2. Submit detailed feature proposal with use cases
3. Participate in discussion to refine the concept
4. Help prioritize through community feedback

The Opossum Search roadmap is a living document that evolves based on user needs, technological advances, and
development resources.
