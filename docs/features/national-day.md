## Implementation Guidelines for Contributors

If you're contributing to Opossum Search and want to enhance the National Opossum Day experience, follow these guidelines:

1. All National Day features must be non-intrusive to normal operation
2. Features should degrade gracefully if resources are constrained
3. Keep special animations and visual elements subtle and professional
4. Ensure all content is family-friendly and educational
5. Use browser storage (localStorage or cookies) for remembering user participation
