# Special Events

*Note: These special events are planned features for future implementation. This document outlines the conceptual design
and implementation possibilities.*

## Seasonal Events

Opossum Search celebrates various occasions throughout the year with temporary features and themed experiences. These
events provide moments of delight for users while showcasing the system's flexibility.

### April Fool's Day (April 1)

For 24 hours on April 1st, Opossum Search implements harmless pranks that surprise and amuse users:

- **Reversed Results**: Search results appear in reverse order
- **Playful Responses**: The system occasionally responds with intentionally silly or overly literal interpretations of
  queries
- **Word Scramble**: Some words in responses are comically scrambled
- **"Did you actually mean..."**: The system suggests absurd alternatives to simple search terms

All April Fool's features can be disabled with the command `no fooling` for users who prefer standard functionality.

### Winter Holidays (December 20-31)

During the winter holiday season, Opossum Search presents a festive experience:

- **Snowy Animations**: Gentle snowflakes fall in the background of the interface
- **Decorated UI**: Subtle holiday decorations appear in UI elements
- **Warm Color Scheme**: The interface shifts to warmer colors
- **Holiday Greetings**: Responses include seasonal well-wishes
- **Gift Recommendations**: Enhanced capabilities for gift suggestion queries

### System Birthday (June 15)

Celebrating the anniversary of the first commit, Opossum Search's birthday includes:

- **Development Statistics**: Users can see fun facts about the system's growth
- **"Year in Review" Visualization**: A special SVG showing the system's journey
- **Thank You Messages**: Special acknowledgments to users and contributors
- **Performance Boost**: Temporary increase in resource allocation for faster responses

## Technical Community Events

### Programmer's Day (September 13/12)

On the 256th day of the year, Opossum Search celebrates programmers with:

- **Code-Friendly Responses**: Enhanced code formatting and syntax highlighting
- **Programming Jokes**: Tech humor in responses
- **Binary Easter Egg**: Typing "01101000 01101001" (binary for "hi") triggers a special greeting
- **Famous Algorithm Visualizations**: Special SVG generation for classic algorithms

### System Administrator Appreciation Day (Last Friday in July)

Honoring the unsung heroes of IT:

- **Uptime Celebration**: Special visualization showing system stability metrics
- **IT Humor**: Responses include classic sysadmin jokes and references
- **Infrastructure Visualizations**: Special diagrams of the Opossum Search architecture
- **"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"**: Easter egg response to certain troubleshooting queries

## Implementing Special Events

Special events in Opossum Search follow these implementation principles:

```python
# Conceptual implementation approach
def check_special_events(request_date):
    """Check for active special events based on date"""
    events = []
    
    # April Fool's Day
    if request_date.month == 4 and request_date.day == 1:
        events.append("april_fools")
    
    # Winter Holidays
    if request_date.month == 12 and 20 <= request_date.day <= 31:
        events.append("winter_holidays")
    
    # System Birthday
    if request_date.month == 6 and request_date.day == 15:
        events.append("system_birthday")
    
    # Programmer's Day (256th day of the year)
    day_of_year = request_date.timetuple().tm_yday
    if day_of_year == 256:
        events.append("programmers_day")
    
    # System Administrator Appreciation Day (last Friday in July)
    if request_date.month == 7:
        last_day = calendar.monthrange(request_date.year, 7)[1]
        last_friday = last_day - calendar.weekday(request_date.year, 7, last_day)
        if request_date.day == last_friday:
            events.append("sysadmin_day")
    
    return events
```

### Feature Flags

Each special event is controlled by a feature flag that can be globally enabled or disabled:

```yaml
# Example configuration
special_events:
  april_fools:
    enabled: true
    intensity: medium  # Options: subtle, medium, obvious
  winter_holidays:
    enabled: true
    intensity: subtle
  system_birthday:
    enabled: true
    intensity: medium
  programmers_day:
    enabled: true
    intensity: subtle
  sysadmin_day:
    enabled: true
    intensity: medium
```

### Event Assets

Special events use dedicated asset collections:

- Themed SVG templates
- Special animation sequences
- Event-specific response modifiers
- Temporary UI element replacements

## Contributor Guidelines

Proposing new special events:

1. Events should be universally appealing and non-controversial
2. Implementation should be lightweight with minimal performance impact
3. All features must degrade gracefully if resources are constrained
4. Events should have an opt-out mechanism for users who prefer standard functionality
5. Plan for accessibility considerations with all visual or interactive elements

## Future Event Concepts

We're considering the following events for future implementation:

- **Pi Day** (March 14): Mathematical visualizations and numerically-themed responses
- **Earth Day** (April 22): Environmentally focused visualizations and energy-efficiency metrics
- **International Talk Like a Pirate Day** (September 19): Arrr! Ye responses be in pirate speak!
- **Halloween** (October 31): Subtle spooky themes and "trick or treat" special command
