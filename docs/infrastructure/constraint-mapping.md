## Sensitivity Analysis

The pipeline uses advanced sensitivity analysis based on Google OR-Tools to optimize resource allocation and improve
resilience:

### Analysis Capabilities

- **Variable Impact Analysis**: Quantifies the contribution of each pipeline stage to overall performance
- **Resource Bottleneck Detection**: Identifies which resources (CPU, memory, GPU, VRAM) are limiting factors
- **Objective Coefficient Ranging**: Determines how changes in stage importance affect solution quality
- **What-If Scenario Modeling**: Tests hypothetical resource configurations without service disruption
- **Automated Recommendations**: Suggests targeted improvements based on operational data

### Implementation Details

The `SensitivityAnalyzer` class provides:

1. **Complete Analysis Workflow**:
   ```python
   analyzer = SensitivityAnalyzer()
   model = analyzer.create_optimization_model(requests, resources)
   status = model.Solve()
   analysis = analyzer.analyze_model(model)
   recommendations = analyzer.generate_recommendations(analysis)

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when
   advanced analysis features aren't available in the
   selected solver
3. **Telemetry Integration**: Performance monitoring for
   analysis operations

This analysis enables data-driven decisions about pipeline
configuration and hardware resource allocation.
## Key Observations & Optimization Priorities

1. **Memory Streaming Priority**: The current file I/O between stages adds 20-25% overhead. Moving to memory streaming could yield the most immediate performance gains.

2. **GPU Resource Management**: Stage 2 (detail enhancement) is the heaviest consumer of GPU resources. A dynamic scheduler should prioritize GPU allocation to this stage.

3. **Consolidated Resource Allocation**: Instead of individual resource checks per stage, implementing a unified resource assessment at the pipeline level allows for optimal allocation across all stages.

4. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**: When resources are constrained, implementing quality reduction (fewer diffusion steps, lower SAM resolution) is better than complete stage skipping.

5. **Parallel Optimization Opportunities**: While the core S1→S2→S3 flow is sequential for a single request, preparation work for later stages can happen in parallel with execution of earlier stages.

6. **Quantization Impact**: Model quantization provides substantial resource savings with minimal quality impact. Reducing VRAM usage by 50-75% enables higher throughput and concurrent processing.

7. **Error Handling Optimization**: Current implementation has cascading failures. The circuit breaker pattern with stage-specific fallbacks would significantly improve reliability.

## Practical Implementation Notes

- Current implementation creates multiple temp directories that could be consolidated
- Error handling currently doesn't distinguish between different failure modes
- Model quantization appears to be configured but not fully implemented in the integration
- Pipeline treats each request independently, missing opportunities for batch processing
- Resource detection happens multiple times instead of once with monitoring
