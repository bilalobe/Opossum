| CI/CD Integration           | Automate testing on changes         | GitHub Actions workflows                         |

## Testing Implementation

```python
# Example test case for failover behavior
import pytest
import asyncio
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

class TestServiceFailover:
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_gemini_to_ollama_failover(self, availability_manager, service_router):
        # Arrange - Mock Gemini as unavailable
        with patch.object(availability_manager, 'get_available_services') as mock_get:
            mock_get.return_value = {"ollama", "transformers"}  # Gemini not available
            
            # Act - Attempt to route a request
            result = await service_router.route_request({"query": "test question"})
            
            # Assert - Request was handled by Ollama
            assert result["fallback_used"] == "ollama"
            assert "response" in result
```

!!! note
    Pay close attention to the Service Uptime and Error Rate metrics in the Validation Dashboard. These are key indicators of overall service availability.
